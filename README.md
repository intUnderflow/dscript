# dscript

DScript is a Decentralized Computation Platform / Cryptocurrency I created in University to explore some new approaches to challenging the problem I hadn't seen elsewhere. This was written when I was a university student, so it may not be excellent code and I'm sure it will have code smells, but I hope that some of the approaches in here are interesting.

You can read the paper here: https://lucy.sh/DScript.pdf

I think the most similar system to DScript (although much more sophisticated) is the excellent work of the engineers and researchers at [Algorand.](https://www.algorand.com)

The paper was published (as are all papers of final year students) in the Brunel University library when I submitted it. But I'm putting this online so that others can look at it.
